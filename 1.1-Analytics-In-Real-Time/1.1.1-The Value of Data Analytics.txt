The Rise of Analytics and Data Science

 - In today's world, it feels like analytics are everywhere — from the way businesses make decisions to how public health is managed. This transition toward data-driven decision-making didn’t happen overnight; it’s been building up over the past few decades.

A Historic Turning Point: The Oakland A’s (2002)

- One of the earliest and most famous examples of using data to gain a competitive advantage came from Major League Baseball in 2002. The general manager of the Oakland A’s, Billy Beane, used data analytics to select undervalued players who were overlooked by traditional scouting methods.

*  By analyzing historical performance data, Beane assembled a low-budget but highly effective team.

*  This strategy, later known as "Moneyball," helped the team outperform richer rivals — showing the real-world impact of smart data analysis.


Data in Public Health: Tracking COVID-19 Variants

- In more recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, data analysis became critical for global health.

*  Governments and health organizations used analytics to track virus spread, predict variant behavior, and guide policy decisions.

*  Without data analysis, efforts like vaccination rollouts or travel restrictions would have been far less effective.


The Big Data Boom: Social Media & IoT

- What’s fueling today’s analytics explosion is the massive volume of data being generated by:

*  Social media platforms (posts, likes, shares, comments)

*  The Internet of Things (IoT) — everyday objects that generate and transmit data.
